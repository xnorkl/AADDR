# Cloudvoyant
(WIP) Cloud Recon Tool.

Inspired by Korey McKinley's [O365Creeper](https://github.com/LMGsec/o365creeper/blob/master/o365creeper.py).  

Takes a UPN or list of UPNs and returns valid email addresses.  
This currently only works with Azure/AAD environments.

## TODO 
Provide cross platform functionality.
